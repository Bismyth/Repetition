  <p class="bodyText lh-2 s-1">The game I created has you repeating the same maze over and over again but at a random point the dead end that existed at the bottom changes to the real exit. This game was inspired by Gilles Deleuze’s work on difference and repetition and how all things come from the differences that we find. By treating each maze as unique leads to the realisation that there might be a new path, so to escape the maze you must first come to an understanding that the difference that can be observed is what creates meaning. In Deleuze’s work he talks of a concept called the virtual that is the space in which all possible things exist and that our reality is just fractions of this space. The maze in some ways symbolises that we often generalise things however every moment is a new possibility from the virtual.</p>
